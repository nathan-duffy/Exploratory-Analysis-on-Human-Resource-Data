## Exploratory Analysis on Human Resource Data
<br>

**Overview:** An academic company in Denver provided me a dataset of applicant tracking data and wanted to see what interesting trends and patterns I could find.  However, I was specifically tasked with finding out why so many of their doctoral candidates were slipping through the cracks.

**Code:** Check out my completed Jupyter Notebook above (Project Notebook.ipynb)

<br>

**Project Outline:** 

1: What is the distribution of education levels applying to Academics? 
<br>
2: Visualizing current status based on education level using a stacked bar chart. 
<br>
3: Why are doctoral candidates not getting hired, what does the data say about this? 
<br>
4: What is the most popular position according to applicant numbers, and which one has the highest desired salary? 
<br>
5: What are the national salary averages of job titles that Academics currently employs? 
<br>
6: Is Academics paying above or below average compared to other cities represented in our new dataset? 
<br>
7: When are there spikes in applications? 
<br>
8: What sort of candidates are getting hired? 
<br>
9: Attempting to predict position based on education level and desired salary.

**Findings:**

I did my best to answer my stakeholder’s original question, and I was able to give some insight into the problem at hand.  I found out that a lot less of the doctoral candidates are applying than other educational levels, more than half of them were categorized as ‘Not a Fit’, they are desiring higher salaries, and mostly applying to be research analysts.  I was then able to provide a detailed report to my stakeholder with to give the department the opportunity to make more informed decisions in their hiring process backed by data that was then implemented.
